				<li>
					<span class="_pageQna">Deposit:</span> Uze providers are charged a deposit of at least 100 when they start the registration. If they violate user terms, the deposit will be taken and they will be downgraded by ratings and get less available deals or banned from using uzespace forever.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="_pageQna">SSN check:</span> Every uze providerâ€™s id is bonded to their ssn, so they cant register after being banned.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="_pageQna">Ratings:</span> Uze providers are required to send pictures of proof of intactness at the beginning and end of the contract period. Signed uze stickers must intact from the start to the end of each order.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="_pageQna">Insurance:</span> We are working with insurance companies to ensure the safety of your personal belongings and help you get compensations if anything gets damaged.
